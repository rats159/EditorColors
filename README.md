# Editor Colors
## How to use
1. Install BepInEx for TFWR ([Tutorial](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html))
2. Download from releases
3. I recommend using [BepInEx Config Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) to edit the colors in-game

### Building from source:
1. Install BepInEx
2. Clone the repo
3. Ensure the path in farmer.targets points to the right place
4. Build

## Examples:
Inside the Examples directory, there are a handful of themes. Feel free to copy any of the config files into your own config folder, and the theme should be automatically loaded

Note that the colors won't be 100% accurate, due to things like sun tint, as well as the color of code windows changing slightly when active.
