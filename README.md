# Editor Colors
## How to use
1. Install BepInEx for TFWR ([Tutorial](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html))
2. Clone the repo into Visual Studio
3. If your TFWR is installed in the default location, you *should* be able to press CTRL+B and have it work seamlessly
   - If your TFWR is installed elsewhere, you'll need to update `farmer.targets`
4. Update the configuration in your BepInEx configuration folder (under `dev.rats159.tfwr.editor_colors`)
   - If you want runtime configuration, use [this](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager)
